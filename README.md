## Shaders 

### CharacterGlow.shadergraph and ZomBunny_Eyes.shadergraphs
these are the main shaders for rendering the ZomBunny.  
both of these are updated by the Status_Effect_Manager.cs script,
and both use the RimGlow subshader.

### RimGlow
this takes in the GlowAnim, GlowColor, and the Normal Vector (world space).
